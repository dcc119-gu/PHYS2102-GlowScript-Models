Compilation of projects from computational modeling for Physics 2102: Electromagnetic Phenomena. Descriptions of each lab are as follows:
1. 
2. 
3. 
\n4. Computed integral of capacitance from measurements taken in real life and compared it to the value given by real equation.
\n5. Modeled & visualized magnetic field at 6 observation points on y-z plane due to proton moving along x-axis.
